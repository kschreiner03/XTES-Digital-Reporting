## 🔬 Technical Architecture & Code Flow

This section details exactly how the application functions under the hood, explaining the relationship between Electron, React, and the data layer.

### 1. The Electron Lifecycle (Main Process)
*   **Entry Point (`main.js`)**: When the app launches, Electron creates a `BrowserWindow` and loads the React app.
*   **IPC Handlers**: The main process listens for specific events from the frontend (Renderer) via `ipcMain.handle`. These include:
    *   `save-project`: Opens a native OS dialog to write JSON data to disk.
    *   `read-file`: securely reads a file from disk and passes the content back to React.
    *   `save-zip-file`: Writes a binary buffer (generated by JSZip) to disk.
*   **Security**: The main process strictly filters file extensions (`.dfr`, `.plog`, etc.) to prevent malicious file access.

### 2. The Bridge (`preload.js`)
*   **Context Isolation**: The Renderer process (React) **cannot** access Node.js APIs (like `fs`) directly.
*   **Exposed API**: The `preload.js` script creates a secure bridge, exposing a global `window.electronAPI` object.
*   **Function**: When React needs to save a file, it calls `window.electronAPI.saveProject(...)`. This sends a message across the bridge to the Main process, which executes the actual filesystem operation.

### 3. The React Frontend (Renderer Process)
*   **Routing (`App.tsx`)**: The app does not use a URL-based router (like `react-router`). Instead, it uses conditional rendering based on a state variable `selectedApp`.
    *   `LandingPage`: The default view.
    *   `PhotoLog`, `DfrStandard`, etc.: The specific report editors.
*   **Component Structure**: Each report type (e.g., `DfrStandard.tsx`) is a self-contained "Sub-App" managing its own state (`headerData`, `bodyData`, `photosData`).

### 4. Data Persistence Strategy (The "Hybrid" Model)
The application uses a three-tier storage strategy to handle large image data without crashing the browser or hitting storage limits.

1.  **LocalStorage (`xtec_recent_projects`)**:
    *   Stores **lightweight metadata only** (Project Name, ID, Timestamp, Type).
    *   Used to render the list on the Landing Page instantly.
2.  **IndexedDB (`db.ts` via `idb`)**:
    *   Stores **heavy binary data** (Base64 images) and full project JSON.
    *   This database allows the app to store hundreds of megabytes of photos offline, bypassing the ~5MB limit of LocalStorage.
    *   When a user clicks a project on the Landing Page, the app queries IndexedDB using the timestamp ID to rehydrate the full state.
3.  **File System (`.plog`, `.dfr`)**:
    *   The "source of truth" for long-term archiving.
    *   These are standard JSON files containing the full state tree.

### 5. Image Processing Pipeline
To ensure generated PDFs are not massive, images undergo processing immediately upon upload:
1.  **Input**: User selects a file (JPG/PNG).
2.  **Canvas Processing**: The image is drawn onto an HTML5 Canvas in memory.
3.  **Auto-Crop**: The canvas forces a **4:3 aspect ratio** (1024x768). If the image is too wide or tall, it is centered and cropped automatically.
4.  **Compression**: The canvas exports the image as a `image/jpeg` Data URL.
5.  **Storage**: This Base64 string is stored in the React state (and subsequently IndexedDB).

### 6. PDF Generation Engine
The app uses `jspdf` to generate PDFs entirely on the client side (no server involved).
*   **Manual Layout**: The PDF is drawn command-by-command (e.g., `doc.text(..., x, y)`).
*   **Dynamic Calculation**: The code calculates the height of every text block and image *before* drawing it to determine if a page break (`doc.addPage()`) is needed.
*   **Pagination Logic**: Complex logic exists in `DfrStandard.tsx` (see `renderTextSection` and `drawPhotoEntry`) to ensure text blocks and photos don't get cut in half across pages.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project follows a standard Electron Forge + Vite template structure, separating the Main process (Node.js) from the Renderer process (React).

### 📁 Root Directory
*   **`main.js`**: **(Electron Main Process)** The entry point of the application. It runs in a Node.js environment and is responsible for:
    *   Creating and managing application windows (`BrowserWindow`).
    *   Handling system events (app ready, window closed).
    *   Interacting with the operating system (File System access via `fs`, Native Dialogs).
    *   Handling IPC (Inter-Process Communication) messages from the frontend (e.g., `save-project`, `generate-pdf`).
    *   Managing Auto-Updates.
*   **`preload.js`**: **(Preload Script)** Runs before the renderer process is loaded. It acts as a secure bridge, exposing specific, limited capabilities from `main.js` to the frontend via `contextBridge`. This prevents the frontend from having full, unsafe access to Node.js APIs.
*   **`App.tsx`**: **(React Entry)** The main React component that acts as the router. It manages the state for which "Sub-App" (Photo Log, DFR, etc.) is currently active and handles the switching logic.
*   **`types.ts`**: Contains all TypeScript interfaces and type definitions used across the application to ensure type safety for data structures like `HeaderData`, `PhotoData`, and report-specific schemas.

### 📁 components/
This directory contains all React components, split into generic UI elements and specific report logic.

#### Report Modules
These components are the "pages" of the application. Each contains its own state management, validation logic, and PDF generation code.
*   **`PhotoLog.tsx`**: Logic for the standard Photographic Log report.
*   **`DfrStandard.tsx`**: Logic for the comprehensive Daily Field Report.
*   **`DfrSaskpower.tsx`**: Specialized logic for SaskPower specific DFRs, including safety checklists.
*   **`CombinedLog.tsx`**: Logic for merging multiple existing project files into one master photo log.
*   **`IogcLeaseAudit.tsx`**: Logic for the IOGC Lease Audit form.
*   **`LandingPage.tsx`**: The dashboard displayed on startup, listing recent projects and entry points for new reports.

#### Shared UI Components
*   **`Header.tsx` / `DfrHeader.tsx`**: Reusable header forms for report metadata (Client, Location, Date).
*   **`PhotoEntry.tsx`**: The complex component handling individual photo uploads, data entry, drag-and-drop, and reordering.
*   **`SafeImage.tsx`**: A wrapper for `<img>` tags that handles safe file protocol loading in Electron production builds.
*   **`BulletPointEditor.tsx`**: A specialized textarea that handles automatic bullet point insertion and indentation behavior.
*   **`ImageModal.tsx`**: Full-screen preview modal for uploaded images.
*   **`SettingsModal.tsx`**: UI for application preferences and data management.

#### Utilities
*   **`db.ts`**: A wrapper around **IndexedDB** using the `idb` library. It handles the offline storage of large image blobs and project states, enabling the "Recent Projects" feature without bloating `localStorage`.
*   **`ThemeContext.tsx`**: Manages the application's light/dark mode state.
*   **`SpecialCharacterPalette.tsx`**: A floating utility for inserting symbols (°, µ, etc.).

### 📁 public/assets/
Static assets that are copied to the build output.
*   **Icons**: `.ico` files for Windows installers and file associations.
*   **Images**: Logos (`xterra-logo.jpg`) and background images.
*   **Help**: `help.html` and associated SOP documents.

### ⚙️ Configuration Files
*   **`forge.config.js`**: Configuration for **Electron Forge**. Defines how the app is packaged (into `.exe`), which assets are included, and sets up file associations (e.g., opening `.dfr` files launches the app).
*   **`vite.config.ts`**: Configuration for **Vite**, the build tool. Handles compiling React, TypeScript, and HMR (Hot Module Replacement) during development.
*   **`tailwind.config.js`**: Configuration for **Tailwind CSS**, defining the color palette (including the custom X-Terra teal `#007D8C`) and dark mode settings.
